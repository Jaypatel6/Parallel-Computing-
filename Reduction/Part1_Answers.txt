The effective bandwidth is calculated by dividing the total (input size * dtype) by the execution time for kernel0. This represents the total throughput by the GPU.

For example, our trial 5 has the output: 

*** Trial 5 ***
N: 8388608
Timer: gettimeofday
Timer resolution: ~ 1 us (?)
Time to execute naive GPU reduction kernel: 0.003348 secs
Effective bandwidth: 10.02 GB/s
Time to execute naive CPU reduction: 0.116279 secs
SUCCESS: GPU: 41.934433 	CPU: 41.934437

BW = (N * sizeof(dtype))/time of execution
